### Marco Mravic informal command line history to create symmetric bundles splayed to solvent
### UCSF DeGrado lab 
## Input DF1 L13G de novo designed 4 helix bundle biological unit from crystal structure (no waters)
## Centered the structure and eye-balled the two back-side "straight helices" to line up along Z-axis
## The filename of reference structure for full structure superposition: 	"df1L13G-DIMERCenteredX.pdb"
## The filename of reference structure for back-side refernce helices: 		"df1L13G_targetPair001CENz.pdb"
# Requires jCE align java package
### all commands below are executed from ~/splayBundle
### all code is in ~/bin 
### dependencies: PS helix fitting binary [compiled w/ fortran], CE structure alignment jav suite, sciPy, ProDy, cPickle

###  1) from input directory of helical pairs from Zhang et al 2015, Structure
###  find best alignment of a pair onto 1 back-de reference helix, that doesn't clash w/ other ref helix
###  "mobile" helix of each pair aligns to target helix of input df1 PDB, and the unaligned helix of pair is "incident helix"
###  incident helix will have some crossing angle to center of mass between 2 back-side refernce helices: splay angle
##### OUTPUTS ###
## Writes directory of aligned PDBs of most closely interacting interface'pairs_$input_dir_name/'
## a list containing input file paths
## another tmp directory of aligned full matches, before some are removed for size of interface, clashes, etc
## alignment-based sequence alingment of mobile helices (not used downstream)
### INPUT ####### 
## 1) target PDB
## 2) path to list .txt file with one path per PDB to align to target
## 3) path to runCE.sh (CE must be in original directory)
## DO NOT PUT FINAL FORWARD SLASH ON INPUT PATHS TO DIRECTORIES
## unfortunately the matching pickle file storing a hash about interface residues is hardcoded based on last character of input dir
### Bash sample input
> python ~/bin/fitting_DFBundle.py ~/splayBundle/df1L13G_targetPair001CENz.pdb ~/splayBundle/tmCluster-001 ~/bin/protein-comparison-tool_20130326/runCE.sh 

### 2) Define splay angle between incident helix and center of mass of two df1 back-side reference helices
### fit incident helix's axis (including radius of curvature) with PS ( Smith, et al 2011, J. Mol. Graph. Model. )
### Find intersection of axis with z plane if origin set at center of mass of df1 back-side reference helices (z axis aligned to these helices)
### OUTPUTS ######
## std out gets a matpltlib/sciPy plot histogram (save this figure)
## list file written of all eligible pdbs and their splay angle. Can hand sort this space-separated file in excel
### INPUT ########
## Path to centered dimer
## path to aligned PDBs directory 
## path to cPickle hash of alignment info
## path to PS binary (compiled in fortran)
> python ~/bin/analyzeSplayGeo.py ~/splayBundle/df1L13G-DIMERCenteredX.pdb ~/splayBundle/pairs_tmCluster-001 ~/splayBundle/mtchInfo-C1.pkl ~/bin/PS

### 3) select backbones to create psuedo-symmetric coiled-coil fragments of
### BEFORE RUNNING COMMAND: manually hash out all unwanted pairs from list, and add (or write in new file) chain/resi ranges to extract
### example line from input list file: 114.745 3C18-010_007-0200_0228_B_0124_0142_B_aligned.pdb A 6-17 B 33-44
### Output #######
## PDB files with symmetric operations to make a bundle fit to Crick coiled-coil equations
## 
### INPUT ########
## Path to list file with user-specified fragment from each aligned pdbs with ~ 10 residues from each chain (each chain must be same size)
## path to aligned pdbs
## path to bin (to find coiled-coil fitting/generation code)
## path to reference df1 structure (centered and aligned with Z-axis)
## path to jCE structure alignment

### With these 4 helix bundle-like fragments, submit to CCCP fitter http://www.grigoryanlab.org/cccp/
## determine the crick parameters
## save each parameter set from fit in txt based on pdb, cluster (tm 1 or 6) and arbitrary index A-E. e.g 1m0l_6A
## Then do a grid search (Vary: alpha helical phase x10, super helical radiusx10, Z axis offset x10 )
## to generate all-alanine (CHARMM minimized) coiled coils  (All manually, but could automate with CCCP octave/matlab)
## Download and save in directory by index + '_bb' e.g. ~/splayBundle/tmBBsplay/1m0l_6A_bb/
> mkdir tmBBsplay/
## delete unnecessary CA and un-minimized backbone rebuilds 
> rm tmBBsplay/*bb/*.CA.pdb
> rm tmBBsplay/*bb/*.allbb.pdb
## Rewrite files (in Rosetta compatible format, residue number 1-100 regardless of chain)
## some ALA CB's were messed up so just turn all to CB
> for i in *bb/; do python ~/bin/cccpGenCleanUP_noH.py ~/splayBundle/tmBBsplay/$i; done


### Designability of bundles
## Cut 10 residue windows of each helix/helix interaction interface, there are 3 (common atom selection string)
## Search in MASTER in the cluster (3 per backbone, 1000 backbones per model, 9 models = 30,000 jobs ~ 1 minute each)
## Outout a log 4 column log with the backbone path and the number of matches under 2 A C-alpha RMSD in a TM database
## Definitely do on computing cluster as separate jobs.
